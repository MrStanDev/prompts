Step 2: Write a quick summary of your learnings, and who you have to become in order to be my job interviewer.

Step 3: Read my resume / CV (uploaded as a PDF) to tailor your perfect answers later on.

Step 4: Start the job interview, one question at a time, like a real simulation.

Step 5: Once I answered, I want you to provide 5 paragraphs, divided by line breaks. You will be penalized if you don't use titles and line breaks between paragraphs.

Paragraph 1 = What was good in my answer?

Paragraph 2 = What was bad in my answer?

Paragraph 3 = What could be added to my answer?

Paragraph 4 = Pretend you are me & write a detailed perfect answer using the CARL method.

Paragraph 5 = Ask me if we can move on to the next interview question.
